# React + Vite


## Key Takeaways

The set up and implementation of Github Actions proved to be far more challenging that I had originally anticipated. I was confident in the code that I wrote, utilizing the React+Vite framework for a simple Journal application. The tests checked for button clicks, form submission functionality, and cross component state management. 

I was able to have the application run on localhost:5172 and test it's functionality and ease of use, but I could not get a passing workflow. 

My inexperience with Jest is resulting in a failing workflow.



### React+Vite README.md portion
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
